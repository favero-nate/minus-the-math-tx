# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book was largely adapted from the public domain resource *Online Statistics Education: A Multimedia Course of Study* (<http://onlinestatbook.com/> Project Leader: David M. Lane, Rice University).

A huge thanks to David Lane and his colleagues at Rice University for their creation of this wonderful resource. I use footnotes throughout to indicate precisely where the various sections of each chapter came from.

Chapters 11-13 (and section 4.4) were written by me (Nathan).

There are still formatting inconsistencies, and this is ever a work in progress. If you find errors, feel free to email me (favero\[at\]american\[dot\]edu) so I can correct them for the next version I publish.

## What's Unique About This Text?

1.  It is a true introduction, not assuming any prior training in statistics.

2.  I try to minimize use of math (beyond the very elementary), instead focusing on conceptual description and interpretation.

3.  I introduce regression very early on (Ch. 3) so that students (especially PhD students) can quickly get started on their term papers and better understand any quantitative articles they're reading. The treatment of regression is further built out in the final chapters (11-13). Regression is, after all, the workhorse of applied statistics for the social sciences.

4.  I skip a traditional treatment of probability theory because I don't find traditional treatments to be very useful for students interested in applied statistics. Instead, I've written a chapter (11) on the logic and practice of building models that account for uncertainty.

5.  There is a bit of Stata code in the final chapter, but otherwise all examples are presented apart from any statistical software package.
